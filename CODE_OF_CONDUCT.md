Team Contract
============

## Purpose of this Contract
This contract establishes shared expectations, responsibilities, and commitments for how our team will collaborate throughout the course. It is designed to ensure accountability, professionalism, and mutual respect, while fostering a positive and productive environment as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

# Team Norms and Expectations
---------------------------

## Communication
- Primary communication platform: Discord (for most discussions) and Instagram (for quick reminders or urgent updates).
- Response time expectation: Each teammate agrees to respond to messages within 12 hours unless otherwise communicated.
- When to notify the team:
  - If unable to meet a deadline or attend a meeting.
  - If progress is delayed or a task needs rescheduling.
  - If any personal issue may temporarily affect contribution.
- Respectful communication guidelines:
  - Listen actively to all ideas before responding.
  - Encourage equal participation from every member.
  - Be open to feedback and constructive criticism.
  - Keep discussions professional and inclusive.
  - Rotate meeting formats (one week online, one week in-person) to accommodate everyone’s schedule.
  - Always meet agreed-upon deadlines and notify others early if issues arise.

## Collaboration and Conduct
- Maintain a positive and supportive attitude toward all members.
- Respect individual working styles and time constraints.
- Be punctual and prepared for all meetings (online or in-person).
- Share progress updates at least once per week.
- Avoid last-minute submissions that create unnecessary pressure on others.
- Communicate any blockers early instead of staying silent.
- Give and receive feedback constructively.

## Work Flow
- UI Development:
  - All members will collaborate on UI design. We will break larger tasks into smaller subtasks and assign them through our project planner.
- Backend Development:
  - The backend will be divided into three sub-teams:
    - Recipes
    - Restaurants
    - Food Data
  - Each sub-team (of two members) can create new sub-issues and assign them to themselves.
- Task Review Process:
  1. After completing a task, mark it as "To Be Reviewed."
  2. Another member reviews for correctness and quality.
  3. Once approved, mark the task as "Done."
- Documentation:
  - Each member must maintain a brief record of their contributions (e.g., a short paragraph in a shared document summarizing what they’ve done). This will form part of the final documentation.

## Accountability & Expectations
- Take initiative and try to solve problems independently before seeking help.
- Ask for help early if you’re blocked — don’t let problems pile up.
- Contribute fairly and maintain balanced workload distribution across all members.
- Document your work so others can understand your contributions and continue from your progress.
- Attend all meetings unless you’ve notified the group in advance.
- Respect project deadlines and other members’ time.
- Follow the team’s coding, design, and communication standards.

## Decision Making
- Team decisions (deadlines, meeting times, feature priorities, etc.) will be made by majority vote via Discord or during meetings.
- In case of a tie or unresolved disagreement, discuss further until consensus is reached or consult the TA for guidance.

## Conflict Resolution
- Private discussion: The concerned member(s) will first talk privately to clarify misunderstandings.
- Team discussion: If unresolved, bring the issue to a team meeting to reach a collective decision.
- External support: If the conflict persists or affects progress, consult the TA or instructor for mediation.
- All discussions should remain respectful and solution-focused.
